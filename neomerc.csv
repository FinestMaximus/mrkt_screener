## U.S.–based companies across key sectors that stand to gain if rising tariffs and import‑substitution policies curb foreign surpluses and boost domestic production. These firms are most insulated from import levies and often benefit directly from protectionist policies:

DE,Deere & Company - Builds ~75% of its equipment in U.S. plants; stands to win share when imports become costlier

URBN,Nuuly (Urban Outfitters) - Urban Outfitters' clothing‑rental arm which may gain appeal as tariffs push up the cost of buying new apparel
NFLX,Netflix Inc. - Subscription‑based streaming service unaffected by tariffs on physical goods—potentially a relative beneficiary if consumers cut back on tariff‑hit discretionary spending elsewhere
